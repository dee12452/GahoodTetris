# Gahood Tetris
Gahood Tetris is my first attempt at making a game. For this project, I used C++ and SDL2 (Thanks SDL2! You guys rock!)

## What is Gahood Tetris?
Simple, it's essentially tetris but built from the ground up by me using the C++ programming language and the SDL2 libarary.

## What's the purpose?
Mostly because it sounded like fun, but my goal is to one day become a mobile game developer. Currently I develop mobile solution apps in Java for my company, but this project has helped me learn many important aspects of C++ and the Android NDK. I've heard that knowledge of Android's NDK will become valuable for when I do start looking for my dream job.
